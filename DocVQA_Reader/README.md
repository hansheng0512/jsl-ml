## DocVAQ Reader
I created a python file called `reader.py` and inside the main function are containing all the method mentioned inside the notebook like `count` and `getNumPartitions`. The reason Im using python file but not notebook is because somehow Im not able to access the JAVA path through my notebook.

Attached the output of the `reader.py`
